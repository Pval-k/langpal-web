# LangPal Prototype

I made LangPal’s prototype with a clean and simple design, like Duolingo, with a top navigation bar and bright buttons. The app has Home, Find Partner, and Profile pages, and it works well on different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile. I added a dark/light mode with an emoji that changes when toggled. Buttons and blocks have hover effects that move slightly to make the interface feel interactive and fun. I built it using React and React Router so the pages are easy to navigate and the code is organized.
